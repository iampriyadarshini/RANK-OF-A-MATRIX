# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import the required library (numpy) in Python to perform matrix operations.
### Step 2: Define the matrix for which the rank is to be calculated
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: Display the rank of the matrix as the output.
## Program:

#Program to find the rank of a matrix.

import numpy as np


A = [[1,2,3],[3,6,9]]


sln = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)


print(sln)
## Output:
